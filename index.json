Data fuels these techniques, so the quality of the data fed into them determines the accuracy of the results. While the amount of data is increasing with the adoption of internet-of-things, most of it is still private. Availability of data limits the application of machine learning. Scientists and industry pioneers are proposing a model that relies on the economics of data markets, where private data can be traded for a price. Cybersecurity analyses of such markets are lacking. In this context, our study makes two contributions. First, it designs a data market for electric vehicle charging stations, which aims to improve the accuracy of electric vehicle charging demand forecasts. Accurate demand forecasts are essential for sustainable operations of the electric vehicle - charging station - power grid ecosystem, which, in turn, facilitates the electrification and decarbonization of the transportation sector. On the other hand, erroneous demand forecasts caused by malicious cyberattacks impose operational challenges to the ecosystem. Thus, the second contribution of our study is to examine the feasibility of false data injection attacks on the data market for electric vehicle charging stations and to propose a defense mechanism against such attacks. We illustrate our results using data from electric vehicle charging stations in Manhattan, New York. We demonstrate that the data market improves forecasting accuracy of charging stations and reduces the effectiveness of false data injection attacks. The purpose of this work is not only to inform electric vehicle charging stations about the economic benefits of data markets, but to promote cyber awareness among data market pioneers and stakeholders.","tags":"","title":"False data injection attacks on data markets for electric vehicle charging stations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhirui Liang","Robert Mieth","Yury Dvorkin","Miguel A.

Current industrial practice typically assumes a certain fraction of the VRES production forecast power as flexibility reserve, even though the VRES variability and uncertainty is a function of weather conditions. Therefore, this paper focuses on weather-driven flexibility reserve sizing and allocation for large-scale wind power installations. First, we propose a method, which generates statistically credible wind power forecast errors based on forecasts of various weather features, thus stressing a given wind power forecast. Then, these errors are mapped into a risk-based reserve requirement, which is then compared with the current extent-based and probability-based requirements. Additionally, the risk-, extent-, and probability-based reserve requirements are allocated to compare their cost and deliverability performance. Throughout the paper, we use real-world data to compute weather-driven flexibility reserve requirements and evaluate their performance using numerical experiments on a 1819-bus NYISO system model with both on- and off-shore wind power installations.","tags":"","title":"Weather-Driven Flexibility Reserve Procurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhirui Liang","Robert Mieth","Yury Dvorkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657238400,"objectID":"13eb3adb8f01e4720ae33d28a93f9191","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/liang2022inertia/","publishdate":"2022-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liang2022inertia/","section":"publication","summary":"Maintaining the stability of renewable-dominant power systems requires the procurement of virtual inertia services from non-synchronous resources (e.g., batteries, wind turbines) in addition to inertia traditionally provided by synchronous resources (e.g., thermal generators). However, the pricing of inertia provision has not been studied in a stochastic electricity market, where the uncertainty characteristics of renewable energy sources (RES) are considered. To fill in this research gap, this paper formulates a chance-constrained stochastic unit commitment model with inertia requirements and computes equilibrium energy, reserve and inertia prices using convex duality. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system show the performance of the proposed pricing mechanism. By allowing new virtual inertia providers to contribute to system inertia requirements, the total operating cost reduces.

The proposed approach uses generator and transmission system reliability models, including failure-to-synchronize and adverse conditions, to compute contingency probabilities. These probabilities are then used to inform a reliability assessment of the system using a suitable risk metric, i.e., expected energy not served. By iteratively learning the response of generators to post-contingency states within the SCUC we ensure reserve deliverability in this risk-assessment.

Load-altering cyberattacks launched via the manipulations of high-wattage appliances and assets are particularly alarming, as they are not continuously monitored by electric power utilities. Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) are among such high-wattage assets. Even EVCSs monitored by the electric power utilities and protected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such cyberattacks cause financial losses to the EVCSs. In this paper, we propose cyber insurance for EVCSs to hedge the economic loss due to such cyberattacks and develop a data-driven cyber insurance design model for public EVCSs. Under mild modeling assumptions, we derive an optimal cyber insurance premium. Then, we ensure the robustness of this optimal premium and investigate the risk of insuring the EVCSs using a suitable risk assessment metric (Conditional Value-at-Risk). A case study with data from EVCSs in Manhattan, New York illustrates our results. Our results demonstrate that risk assessment is crucial for designing insurance premiums. Furthermore, the premium increases in proportion to the loss coverage offered for the EVCSs. This work informs the stakeholders involved in the roll-out and operation of public EVCSs about the benefits of cyber insurance and suggests that insurance premiums can be reduced by deploying state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.","tags":"","title":"Cyber insurance against cyberattacks on electric vehicle charging stations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Weinhold","Robert Mieth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"ec9dbd41138c646542a364e45fda8a36","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/weinhold2021power/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weinhold2021power/","section":"publication","summary":"The proposed open-source Power Market Tool (POMATO) aims to enable research on interconnected modern and future electricity markets in the context of the physical transmission system and its secure operation.

This generally implies applying some safety margins on uncertain parameters that may only be observable through a finite set of historical samples. Nevertheless, the optimized decisions must be resilient to all probable outcomes, while ideally providing some measure of severity of any potential violations in the less probable outcomes. It is known that the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) can be used to quantify risk in an optimization task, though may also impose overly conservative margins. Therefore, this letter develops a means of co-optimizing the value-at-risk (VaR) level associated with the CVaR to guarantee resilience in probable cases while providing a measure of the average violation in less probable cases. To further combat uncertainty, the CVaR and VaR co-optimization is extended in a distributionally robust manner using the Wasserstein metric to establish an ambiguity set constructed from finite samples, which is guaranteed to contain the true distribution with a certain confidence.","tags":"","title":"Co-optimization of VaR and CVaR for data-driven stochastic demand response auction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Weinhold","Robert Mieth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589414400,"objectID":"8704745cfcf5ea0a77c13005d23b9886","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/weinhold2020fast/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weinhold2020fast/","section":"publication","summary":"Determining contingency aware dispatch decisions by solving a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) is challenging for real-world power systems, as the high problem dimensionality often leads to impractical computational requirements. This problem becomes more severe when the SCOPF has to be solved not only for a single instance, but for multiple periods, e.g. in the context of electricity market analyses. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies the minimal set of constraints that exactly define the space of feasible nodal injections for a given network and contingency scenarios. By internalizing the technical limits of the nodal injections and enforcing a minimal worst-case impact of contingencies to line flows, computational effort can be further improved. The case study applies and analyzes the methods on the IEEE 118 and A\u0026M 2000 bus systems, as well as the German and European transmission systems. In all tested cases the proposed algorithm identifies at least 95% of the network and security constraints as redundant, leading to significant SCOPF solve time reductions. Scalability and practical implementation are explicitly discussed. The code and input data of the case study is published supplementary to the paper under an open-source license.","tags":"","title":"Fast Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow Through Low-Impact and Redundancy Screening","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Hassan","Robert Mieth","Deepjyoti Deka","Yury Dvorkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588809600,"objectID":"3fe6896491e0c9cf97ad8f52cfe31251","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/hassan2020stochastic/","publishdate":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hassan2020stochastic/","section":"publication","summary":"Demand response (DR) programs aim to engage distributed demand-side resources in providing ancillary services for electric power systems. Previously, aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have been demonstrated as a technically viable and economically valuable provider of such services that can effectively compete with conventional generation resources in reducing load peaks and smoothing demand fluctuations. Yet, to provide these services at scale, a large number of TCLs must be accurately aggregated and operated in sync. This paper describes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that aggregates and models an ensemble of TCLs. Using the MDP framework, we propose to internalize the exogenous uncertain dynamics of TCLs by means of stochastic and distributionally robust optimization. First, under mild assumptions on the underlying uncertainty, we derive analytical stochastic and distributionally robust control policies for dispatching a given TCL ensemble. Second, we further relax these mild assumptions to allow for a more delicate treatment of uncertainty, which leads to distributionally robust MDP formulations with moment- and Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets that can be efficiently solved numerically. The case study compares the analytical and numerical control policies using a simulated ensemble of 1,000 air conditioners.","tags":"","title":"Stochastic and Distributionally Robust Load Ensemble Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Mieth","Yury Dvorkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"6fe9be9092570c10b12d3d244d427b50","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/mieth2019online/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mieth2019online/","section":"publication","summary":"Flexible demand response (DR) resources can be leveraged to accommodate the stochasticity of some distributed energy resources. This paper develops an online learning approach that continuously estimates price sensitivities of residential DR participants and produces such price signals to the DR participants that ensure a desired level of DR capacity. The proposed learning approach incorporates the dispatch decisions on DR resources into the distributionally robust chance-constrained optimal power flow (OPF) framework. This integration is shown to adequately remunerate DR resources and co-optimize the dispatch of DR and conventional generation resources. The distributionally robust chance-constrained formulation only relies on empirical data acquired over time and makes no restrictive assumptions on the underlying distribution of the demand uncertainty. The distributional robustness also allows for robustifying the otpimal solution against systematically misestimating empirically learned parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed learning approach is shown via numerical experiments.

We show that the resulting DLMPs consist of the terms that allow to itemize the prices for the active and reactive power production, balancing regulation, network power losses, and voltage support provided. Finally, we prove the proposed DLMP constitute a competitive equilibrium, which can be leveraged for designing a distribution electricity market, and show that imposing chance constraints on voltage limits distorts the equilibrium.","tags":"","title":"Distribution electricity pricing under uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

This paper describes a decomposable approach to leverage the dispatch flexibility of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) for operating distribution systems with a high penetration level of photovoltaic resources. Each TCL ensemble is modeled using the Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP model is then integrated with a chance constrained optimal power flow that accounts for the uncertainty of photovoltaic resources. Since the integrated optimization model cannot be solved efficiently by existing dynamic programming methods or off-the-shelf solvers, this paper proposes an iterative spatiotemporal dual decomposition algorithm (ST-D2).

Thanks to transmission system operators' foresightedness with regard to grid planning, as well as generous financial incentives related to grid expansion, Germany's energy transition has not been impeded by transmission congestion in the electricity grid to date. So far, grid expansion planning already accounted for German renewable energy targets, the nuclear phase- out, and the European Emissions Trading System. From now on, the planning framework also includes scenarios which explicitly account for German emissions reduction targets. The level of CO2 emissions from power stations is to be cut to 187 million tons and 134 million tons by 2025 and 2035, respectively, compared with 317 million tons in 2013. Unlike last year's version of the scenario framework, the latest draft put forward by transmission system operators included a significant increase in lignite-based power generating capacities. In contrast, the version that has now been approved by the German government contains specifications for lignite-based power generation which, depending on the scenario, are five to seven gigawatts lower than the values set down in the draft.","tags":"","title":"Electricity grids and climate targets: new approaches to grid planning","type":"publication"}]
