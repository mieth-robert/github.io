This paper develops an iterative approach, inspired by the current security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) practice, enabling system operators to determine risk-cognizant contingency reserve requirements and their allocation with minimal alterations to the current SCUC practice. The proposed approach uses generator and transmission system reliability models, including failure-to-synchronize and adverse conditions, to compute contingency probabilities. These probabilities are then used to inform a reliability assessment of the system using a suitable risk metric, i.e., expected energy not served. By iteratively learning the response of generators to post-contingency states within the SCUC we ensure reserve deliverability in this risk-assessment. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium update of the Reliability Test System.","tags":"","title":"Risk-Aware Dimensioning and Procurement of Contingency Reserve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samrat Acharya","Robert Mieth","Charalambos Konstantinou","Ramesh Karri","Yury Dvorkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638921600,"objectID":"0bb0e647583685a8a5b416409577c57c","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/acharya2021cyber/","publishdate":"2021-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acharya2021cyber/","section":"publication","summary":"Cyberattacks in the energy sector are commonplace. Load-altering cyberattacks launched via the manipulations of high-wattage appliances and assets are particularly alarming, as they are not continuously monitored by electric power utilities. Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) are among such high-wattage assets. Even EVCSs monitored by the electric power utilities and protected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such cyberattacks cause financial losses to the EVCSs. In this paper, we propose cyber insurance for EVCSs to hedge the economic loss due to such cyberattacks and develop a data-driven cyber insurance design model for public EVCSs. Under mild modeling assumptions, we derive an optimal cyber insurance premium. Then, we ensure the robustness of this optimal premium and investigate the risk of insuring the EVCSs using a suitable risk assessment metric (Conditional Value-at-Risk). A case study with data from EVCSs in Manhattan, New York illustrates our results. Our results demonstrate that risk assessment is crucial for designing insurance premiums. Furthermore, the premium increases in proportion to the loss coverage offered for the EVCSs. This work informs the stakeholders involved in the roll-out and operation of public EVCSs about the benefits of cyber insurance and suggests that insurance premiums can be reduced by deploying state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.","tags":"","title":"Cyber insurance against cyberattacks on electric vehicle charging stations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Weinhold","Robert Mieth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"ec9dbd41138c646542a364e45fda8a36","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/weinhold2021power/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weinhold2021power/","section":"publication","summary":"The proposed open-source Power Market Tool (POMATO) aims to enable research on interconnected modern and future electricity markets in the context of the physical transmission system and its secure operation.

To enable risk trading, the probability space of underlying uncertainty is discretized in a finite number of outcomes, which makes it possible to design practical risk contracts and to produce energy, balancing reserve and risk prices.

This generally implies applying some safety margins on uncertain parameters that may only be observable through a finite set of historical samples. Nevertheless, the optimized decisions must be resilient to all probable outcomes, while ideally providing some measure of severity of any potential violations in the less probable outcomes. It is known that the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) can be used to quantify risk in an optimization task, though may also impose overly conservative margins. Therefore, this letter develops a means of co-optimizing the value-at-risk (VaR) level associated with the CVaR to guarantee resilience in probable cases while providing a measure of the average violation in less probable cases. To further combat uncertainty, the CVaR and VaR co-optimization is extended in a distributionally robust manner using the Wasserstein metric to establish an ambiguity set constructed from finite samples, which is guaranteed to contain the true distribution with a certain confidence.","tags":"","title":"Co-optimization of VaR and CVaR for data-driven stochastic demand response auction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Weinhold","Robert Mieth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589414400,"objectID":"8704745cfcf5ea0a77c13005d23b9886","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/weinhold2020fast/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weinhold2020fast/","section":"publication","summary":"Determining contingency aware dispatch decisions by solving a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) is challenging for real-world power systems, as the high problem dimensionality often leads to impractical computational requirements. This problem becomes more severe when the SCOPF has to be solved not only for a single instance, but for multiple periods, e.g. in the context of electricity market analyses. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies the minimal set of constraints that exactly define the space of feasible nodal injections for a given network and contingency scenarios. By internalizing the technical limits of the nodal injections and enforcing a minimal worst-case impact of contingencies to line flows, computational effort can be further improved. The case study applies and analyzes the methods on the IEEE 118 and A\u0026M 2000 bus systems, as well as the German and European transmission systems. In all tested cases the proposed algorithm identifies at least 95% of the network and security constraints as redundant, leading to significant SCOPF solve time reductions. Scalability and practical implementation are explicitly discussed.

Previously, aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have been demonstrated as a technically viable and economically valuable provider of such services that can effectively compete with conventional generation resources in reducing load peaks and smoothing demand fluctuations. Yet, to provide these services at scale, a large number of TCLs must be accurately aggregated and operated in sync. This paper describes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that aggregates and models an ensemble of TCLs. Using the MDP framework, we propose to internalize the exogenous uncertain dynamics of TCLs by means of stochastic and distributionally robust optimization. First, under mild assumptions on the underlying uncertainty, we derive analytical stochastic and distributionally robust control policies for dispatching a given TCL ensemble. Second, we further relax these mild assumptions to allow for a more delicate treatment of uncertainty, which leads to distributionally robust MDP formulations with moment- and Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets that can be efficiently solved numerically. The case study compares the analytical and numerical control policies using a simulated ensemble of 1,000 air conditioners.","tags":"","title":"Stochastic and Distributionally Robust Load Ensemble Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Mieth","Yury Dvorkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"6fe9be9092570c10b12d3d244d427b50","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/mieth2019online/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mieth2019online/","section":"publication","summary":"Flexible demand response (DR) resources can be leveraged to accommodate the stochasticity of some distributed energy resources.

This integration is shown to adequately remunerate DR resources and co-optimize the dispatch of DR and conventional generation resources. The distributionally robust chance-constrained formulation only relies on empirical data acquired over time and makes no restrictive assumptions on the underlying distribution of the demand uncertainty.

From the system perspective, their reliable and cost effective integration requires accounting for their physical properties in operating tools used by the DSO. This paper describes a decomposable approach to leverage the dispatch flexibility of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) for operating distribution systems with a high penetration level of photovoltaic resources. Each TCL ensemble is modeled using the Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP model is then integrated with a chance constrained optimal power flow that accounts for the uncertainty of photovoltaic resources. Since the integrated optimization model cannot be solved efficiently by existing dynamic programming methods or off-the-shelf solvers, this paper proposes an iterative spatiotemporal dual decomposition algorithm (ST-D2). We demonstrate the merits of the proposed integrated optimization and ST-D2 algorithm on the IEEE 33-bus test system.","tags":"","title":"Optimal Load Ensemble Control in Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Mieth","Yury Dvorkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"eb97f16835e97a08ceba85abc6899094","permalink":"https://mieth-robert.github.io/publication/mieth2018data/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mieth2018data/","section":"publication","summary":"Increasing penetration of distributed energy resources complicate operations of electric power distribution systems by amplifying volatility of nodal power injections. On the other hand, these resources can provide additional control means to the distribution system operator (DSO). In this work we develop a data-driven distributionally robust decision-making framework in the DSO's perspective to overcome the uncertainty of these injections and its impact on the distribution system operations. We develop an ac optimal power flow formulation for radial distribution systems based on the LinDistFlow ac power flow approximation and exploit distributionally robust optimization to immunize the optimized decisions against uncertainty in the probabilistic models of forecast errors obtained from the available observations. The model is reformulated to be computationally tractable and tested on multiple IEEE distribution test systems.","tags":"","title":"Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" [03/10/22] Our work The Electric Commute: Envisioning 100% Electrified Mobility in New York City secured a longlist placement at the 2022 Information is Beautiful Awards.\n[14/09/22] !!!
